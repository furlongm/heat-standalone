# Heat standalone

Set a VM with build.sh as its launch script, and modify AUTH_URL as appropriate

Attach a floating IP and open port 8004

To use, you'll need to set

    export HEAT_URL=http://[floating_ip_addr]:8004/v1/8a088db117e04a3c8480d9977796f661
    export OS_NO_CLIENT_AUTH=True

along with the usual stuff in an openrc
